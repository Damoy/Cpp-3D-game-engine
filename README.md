# Tower3D
A small Tower-Defense 3D game made in C++ OpenGL from scratch for an university project.

**If problems are encountered:
Please check if you have glut32.dll in the executable folder, and if you build one, check your dependencies :)**

*Dependencies are: GLEW, GLFW, GLM, STBI and GLUT.*
Solution has fully been made under Debug configuration, x86, win32

**To see the project arborescence as I do, on Visual, on the solution explorer, click on "show all files", you will see res, src folders and the ClassDiagram.cd file.**

*Solution has been made in Visual Studio 15, on 17+, will require a project update.*
*Please if you have any trouble regarding the build / execution, contact me at damien.fornali@gmail.com*

*A class diagram generated by Visual Studio is available in the project.*
